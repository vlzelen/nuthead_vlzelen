<p>Yet another webring on neocities. Just a webring, as I haven't thought of more global idea behind it yet.</p>
<h3>Our killer-feature</h3>
<p>You don't have to interact and wait for ringmaster or members to join us. We'll include you in our list automagically <i>(if everything will be working as supposed)</i></p>
<h2>How to join</h2>
<h3>Confirm that you have neocities site</h3>
<p>There's only one restriction - your site must be hosted on neocities. Open <a href='https://nutheadnullring.onrender.com/'>sign up form</a> and follow instructions.</p>
<h3>Put script on your site</h3>
<p>Currently, you can ause default flavour with static buttons.</p>
<code>
&lt;script src="https://nuthead.neocities.org/ring/ring.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
<p>There is also <a href='widgetv2.htm'>experimental version with some extra features</a></p>
